# Android Prework - *Hello World*

Submitted by: **Darius Nguyen**

**Hello World** is an android app that shows an image and introductory message, and allows pressing a button to display a Toast.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] Image and introductory message displayed on screen
* [x] Button displayed on screen
* [x] Toast with message appears when button is pressed

I did not implement optional features because I feel like this is meant to be a simple HelloWorld app. However, I do plan to incorporate the suggested UI design guidelines to polish future apps.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:
